Class 2 -

Recap -
      BDD - It allows us to write scenarios in gherkin language

      Feature - User story
      Scenario - Test case - every test case will be considered as scenario in BDD
      Given - pre-requisite/pre-condition
      When - perform actions
      Then - Expected output
      And - Supporting tag

      Step definition - Cucumber provides you the snippet of step definition
      In step definition, we write the code to perform actions which has been written in
      the BDD statement

      To execute all the feature files from one class, we need runner class

To keep everything organised we need framework -
Framework allows you to write simplified and organised code and
it provides folder to structure which is easily understandable

In framework, we have 2 separate branches for
Java -  In java, we write all java classes
Non - Java - In non-java, we write non java part such as features, files etc
