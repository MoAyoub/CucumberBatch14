page object model is a design pattern



Class 5 -
        Recap - runner class - to run our test cases as per the requirement
                                to generate missing steps
                                to print the steps into the console
                                to generate the report

        Page object model - to have organised code and easy to maintain structure
        according to it, we create separate class (page) according to the
        screens available in the application and keep all the locators of this page
        in it

Hooks - we write pre condition and post condition using hooks in cucumber
    @Before - pre condition needs to be mentioned in this
    @After - post condition needs to be mentioned in this

Rules - Hooks class must be created inside steps package

Background - it is applicable only for one feature file
             it means for every feature file background will be different
             steps which are common among all the scenarios of that featur file
             will be taken into background but make sure the flow is not broken.
             if the flow breaks, then we cannot take steps in background after that


Hooks VS background

Hooks are applicable for whole project (for all the feature files)
Background is applicable for one feature file and varies from file to file
First Hooks execute then background execute then scenario execute
